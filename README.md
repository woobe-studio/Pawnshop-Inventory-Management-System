# Pawnshop Inventory Management System

A console-based application designed to efficiently manage the inventory of a pawnshop. This system allows users to add, edit, search, and delete items in the inventory using C and basic file handling.

## 🛠️ How to Run

### Prerequisites

- A C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Windows OS (for console-specific functions like `SetConsoleCursorPosition`)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Pawnshop-Inventory-Management-System.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
    ```bash
    cd Pawnshop-Inventory-Management-System
    ```
3. **Compile the Code**:
    ```bash
    gcc -o pawnshop_inventory main.c
    ```

I've noticed an issue with correctly displaying the data from the file, and I will work on fixing it.
